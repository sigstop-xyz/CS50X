Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

The Last 6 where pretty mixed up in the lower trys and only at the 1000 tries did i get sorted out.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

It seems like the predictions stabilized after about... 100000
